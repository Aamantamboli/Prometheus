# What is Prometheus?
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It is widely used in cloud-native environments and microservices architectures.

# Key features 
- **Time Series Database:** Prometheus stores metrics as time series data, allowing for detailed performance monitoring over time.<br>
- **Multi-dimensional Data Model:** Metrics are identified by a name and associated key/value pairs (labels), enabling flexible and powerful queries.<br>
- **Powerful Query Language:** Prometheus provides PromQL, a robust query language for selecting and aggregating time series data.<br>
- **Pull Model:** It collects metrics by scraping HTTP endpoints at specified intervals, which simplifies data gathering from various services.<br>
- **Alerting:** Prometheus supports alerting rules that can trigger notifications based on specific conditions, integrating seamlessly with Alertmanager.<br>
- **Service Discovery:** It can automatically discover targets to scrape metrics from, making it suitable for dynamic environments.<br>
- **Visualization Integration:** While Prometheus does not offer extensive visualization tools, it integrates well with platforms like Grafana for creating dashboards.<br>

Prometheus is a powerful solution for real-time monitoring, helping developers and operators maintain the health and performance of their applications and infrastructure.
